## Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to learn how to make a contribution to one of my projects!

### Contributions

To give you an idea of which contributions are accepted or rejected, here are some examples of
acceptable and unacceptable contributions.

#### Acceptable Contributions

- When you encounter an unexpected problem, open an Issue with a
  [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
- Comment on Issues, Discussions, or Pull Requests to provide constructive feedback or functional
  examples.
- Start a Discussion about a new feature idea.
- Submit a Pull Request that resolves an existing Issue.
- Submit a Pull Request that adds to the existing documentation.

#### Unacceptable Contributions

- Please **do not** open an Issue for support questions. Use a Discussion instead.
- Please **do not** submit a Pull Request for an undocumented feature idea. All feature ideas should
  start as Discussions to ensure we have the chance to properly talk about and vet the ideas.
- Please **do not** submit a Pull Request purely for code quality (linting, refactoring, reorganizing,
  etc).
- Please **do not** comment on an Issue, Discussion, or Pull Request to engage in arguments or promote
  harassment. See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/darkobits/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilities in public. Send an email to
  [hello@joshua.dev](mailto:hello@joshua.dev) instead.
