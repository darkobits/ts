# Configuration Files

This section will walk you through setting up the configuration files required
by the various tools used by `ts`. If you are already familiar with setting up
these tools, this process should be straightforward. Each base configuration
provided by `ts` comes in one of two variants depending on whether the
underlying tool's configuration supports an `extends` option:

* For tools that support an `extends` option, `ts` will provide a string literal
  pointing to its base configuration file. Simply provide this value as the
  `extends` option in the tool's configuration file.
* For tools that do not support `extends`, `ts` will provide a function that
  accepts a configuration object and will perform a recursive merge with its
  base configuration and return the merged object to the tool.

## NPS

[NPS](https://github.com/sezna/nps) is used to manage and coordinate tasks,
keeping your `package.json` "scripts" section terse while still giving the
developer the flexibility to write custom scripts using the full power of
JavaScript. To configure NPS, create `package-scripts.js` in your project root.
To use the base package scripts from `ts`, call the `nps` configuration
function:

> `package-scripts.js`

```js
module.exports = require('@darkobits/ts').nps();
```

To define additional package scripts, pass an object to `nps`:

```js
module.exports = require('@darkobits/ts').nps({
  scripts: {
    // Long form:
    foo: {
      description: 'My awesome script.',
      script: 'foo --bar --baz'
    },
    // Short form:
    bar: 'bar --qux'
  }
});
```

#### Advanced Usage

In addition to passing an object literal to `nps`, you may also pass a function
that returns an object literal. This function is passed an object with a single
key, `npsUtils`, which is a reference to the `nps-utils` utility library. For
a full list of functions provided, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/nps-utils).
The two most useful utilities provided by `nps-utils` are `series` and
`concurrent`, which allow you to compose complex scripts.

```js
module.exports = require('@darkobits/ts').nps(({ npsUtils }) => ({
  scripts: {
    // Create a package script "foo" which runs the commands "bar" and "baz" in
    // parallel.
    foo: npsUtils.concurrent({
      bar: 'bar',
      baz: 'baz'
    })
  }
}));
```

Once you have created this file, you can get a list of all package scripts by
running:

```
npx nps --scripts
```

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the base scripts provided by `ts`.
You may also wish to create aliases to commonly-used scripts in `package.json`.
At the very least, it is recommended that you alias the `prepare` script, which
NPM will then run as a lifecycle phase after `npm install`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "nps prepare"
}
```

?> NPS supports partial string matching for script names. For
example, to run the script `build.watch`, you only need to type `nps b.w`. âœ¨

## ![Babel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441546/100516407-80935180-3138-11eb-9a98-b9c0fdeb3014.png ':size=128') :id=babel

Babel is used to transpile your code, while the TypeScript compiler is used for
type-checking and for generating declaration files. To configure Babel, create
`babel.config.js` in your project root and `extend` the `ts` base configuration.

> `babel.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: require('@darkobits/ts').babel
};
```

## ![TypeScript](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441546/100515271-b122bd80-312f-11eb-9137-a3cae4ce8ef1.png ':size=22') TypeScript :id=type-script

In your project root, create `tsconfig.json`. Then, `extend` the TypeScript
configuration from `ts`.

When configuring TypeScript, there are a few fields that _must_ be declared
directly in your project's `tsconfig.json` because TypeScript resolves paths
relative to the `tsconfig.json` in which they were defined.

> `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "@darkobits/ts/tsconfig.json",
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "outDir": "dist"
  }
}
```

## ![Jest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441546/100515295-db747b00-312f-11eb-9368-7e58dfeef76c.png ':size=20') Jest :id=jest

Jest is used for unit-testing your project. To configure Jest, create
`jest.config.js` in your project root, then invoke the Jest configuration
function from `ts`.

> `jest.config.js`

```js
module.exports = require('@darkobits/ts').jest();
```

To provide additional/custom configuration:

```js
module.exports = require('@darkobits/ts').jest({
  // Add your custom Jest configuration here.
});
```

## ![ESLint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441546/100515367-72413780-3130-11eb-9242-76f2823274ce.png ':size=20') ESLint :id=eslint

ESLint is used to reduce bugs by encouraging best practices and consistent code
style. To configure ESLint, create `.eslintrc.js` in your project root. Then,
`extend` the ESLint configuration from `ts`.

> `.eslintrc.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: require('@darkobits/ts').eslint,
}
```
