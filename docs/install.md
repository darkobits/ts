# Install

### Existing Projects

To add `ts` to an existing project, run:

```
npm install --save-dev @darkobits/ts
```

Then, follow the instructions in the [Configuration Files](configuration-files) section to configure the
various tools provided by `ts`.

### New Projects

The easiest way to start a new project using `ts` is to use the template repository [`ts-template`](https://github.com/darkobits/ts-template). This
repository is a "batteries included" template that contains everything you need to start coding your
next project in just a few minutes.

1. Create a fork of the template repository and follow the instructions to clone the repository to your
   local machine.
2. From the repository root, run `npm install` to install dependencies, build, type-check, unit test,
   and lint the project.
3. Update the `name`, `author`, `description`, and `repository` fields in `package.json`.
4. Happy coding! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

When using the template repository, you will not need to manually create configuration files yourself.
However, you should still read through the [Configuration Files](configuration-files) and [Running Scripts](running-scripts)
sections of the documentation to learn how to use `ts` effectively.
