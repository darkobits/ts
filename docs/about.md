`ts` is an integrated toolchain for building, testing, and releasing modern TypeScript projects. It can
be compared to tools like `create-react-app`, with a focus on quality and flexibility. Its target
audience is experienced developers who are familiar with modern JavaScript tooling and are looking for a
way to simplify and consolidate their build and release process across their projects.

The two principal features of `ts` are:

### Dependency Management

All [common dependencies](features) needed to build and release a modern, high-quality
JavaScript/TypeScript project are provided by `ts`. Using a single dependency for a project's entire
toolchain reduces the maintenance burden of keeping dependencies up to date and ensures tooling and
related plugins are kept in sync and compatible, allowing the developer to focus building awesome
software. âœ¨

### Configuration

`ts` is opinionated insofar as it ships with a default configuration for each tool it provides. However,
base configurations can always be customized to suit a project's needs, or not used at all. This makes
`ts` highly flexible by default without having to **"[eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)"**.
