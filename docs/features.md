# Features

`ts` uses these incredible tools under the the hood to keep your project running
smoothly:

* Transpilation with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
* Type-checking and declaration file generation with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
* Unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
* Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
* Version and change log management with [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).
* Easily check for newer versions of dependencies with [`npm-check`](https://github.com/dylang/npm-check).
* Package script management with [NR](https://github.com/darkobits/nr).

It is recommended that you have at least a working knowledge of these tools
before installing `ts`.
