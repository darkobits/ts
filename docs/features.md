# Features

`ts` uses these incredible tools under the the hood to keep your project running
smoothly:

* Transpilation with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
* Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
* Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
* Version and change log management with either:
  * [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for manual releasing locally.
  * [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated releasing from CI.
* Easily check for newer versions of dependencies with [`npm-check-updates`](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates).
* Package script management with [`nr`](https://github.com/darkobits/nr).

It is recommended that you have at least a working knowledge of these tools
before installing `ts`.
